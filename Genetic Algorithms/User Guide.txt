To make this run, place the map in the correct place 
(If running from the .exe, that's the release folder. Else it's the 'Genetic Algorithm' folder)

Rename the map to map.txt

When the program runs, the console will ask if you want to run A* or GA.
Select the desired option and wait for it to work.
Re-start the program with the new map in place to test another map.

It may be necessary to edit the project properties to read the dlls and SDKs from the correct directory 
after downloading the project.

You will probably need to adjust the SDK to one you have got installed in the project properties also.
